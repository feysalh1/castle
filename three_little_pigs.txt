Once upon a time, there were three little pigs who decided to build their own houses. The first pig built a house of straw because it was quick and easy. The second pig built a house of sticks. The third pig worked hard to build a strong house of bricks. One day, a big bad wolf came along. He huffed and puffed and blew down the house of straw! The first pig ran to the second pig's house. The wolf huffed and puffed and blew down the house of sticks too! Both pigs ran to the third pig's brick house. The wolf huffed and puffed, but he could not blow down the strong brick house. The wolf tried to come down the chimney, but the pigs had a pot of hot soup waiting! The wolf ran away, and the three little pigs lived happily ever after in the brick house.
