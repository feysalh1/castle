Jack and Jill went up the hill To fetch a pail of water. Jack fell down and broke his crown, And Jill came tumbling after. Up Jack got, and home did trot, As fast as he could caper, To old Dame Dob, who patched his nob With vinegar and brown paper. When Jill came in, how she did grin To see Jack's paper plaster; Mother vexed, did whip her next, For laughing at Jack's disaster.
