Space Explorer Sam

Sam built a rocket ship in the backyard. It was shiny and silver with a red door.
"Today," said Sam, "I'm going to explore space!"

Sam put on a space helmet and climbed inside the rocket.
"3... 2... 1... BLAST OFF!" The rocket zoomed up into the sky!

First, Sam visited the Moon. It was gray and dusty.
"The Moon has no air," said Sam. "And look at all these craters!"
Sam bounced around in the low gravity. "Boing! Boing! Boing!"

Next, Sam flew to Mercury. "Wow, it's so hot here!" said Sam.
Mercury was closest to the Sun, so it was very, very hot.
"Too hot for me!" Sam quickly jumped back in the rocket.

Then Sam visited Venus. It was covered in thick clouds.
"Venus has poisonous air," said Sam. "I'll stay in my rocket for this planet!"

Sam flew to Mars next. It was red and rocky.
"Mars has tall mountains and deep valleys," said Sam.
Sam picked up a red rock to take home as a souvenir.

After Mars, Sam saw Jupiter. It was ENORMOUS!
"Jupiter is the biggest planet," said Sam. "Look at that giant red spot! It's actually a big storm."

Next was Saturn with its beautiful rings.
"The rings are made of ice and rock," said Sam. "They sparkle like diamonds!"

Sam zoomed past Uranus, which was tilted on its side.
"Uranus looks like it's rolling around the Sun," laughed Sam.

The last planet was Neptune, dark blue and windy.
"Neptune has the fastest winds in the whole solar system," said Sam, as the rocket wobbled in the strong breeze.

Beyond Neptune, Sam saw tiny Pluto.
"You're a dwarf planet now," Sam told Pluto, "but you're still special!"

Then Sam's rocket turned around and headed for home.
"Earth is the most beautiful planet of all," said Sam, looking at the blue oceans and green lands.

Sam's rocket landed gently in the backyard.
"What an adventure!" said Sam. "Tomorrow, I'll explore the deep sea!"

But that's another story...
