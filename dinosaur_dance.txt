Dinosaur Dance

The music starts, it's time to play,
At the dinosaur dance party today!

Tyrannosaurus Rex does the STOMP!
Big feet pounding, STOMP! STOMP! STOMP!
His arms are short but his legs are strong,
He stomps to the beat all day long!

Triceratops does the NOD!
Swinging horns from side to side, NOD! NOD! NOD!
Three horns moving with the beat,
The Triceratops dance can't be beat!

Stegosaurus does the WIGGLE!
Tail plates swaying, WIGGLE! WIGGLE! WIGGLE!
Spiky tail moving to and fro,
Stegosaurus puts on quite a show!

Pterodactyl does the FLAP!
Wings spread wide, FLAP! FLAP! FLAP!
Soaring high above the ground,
Making whooshing, flapping sounds!

Brachiosaurus does the STRETCH!
Long neck reaching, STRETCH! STRETCH! STRETCH!
Taller than the tallest trees,
Swaying gently in the breeze!

Velociraptor does the SPIN!
Twirling fast, SPIN! SPIN! SPIN!
Quick and clever on its toes,
Round and round the raptor goes!

All the dinosaurs dance together,
Stomping, nodding, with feather and leather.
The dinosaur dance is so much fun,
Let's do it again when the song is done!
