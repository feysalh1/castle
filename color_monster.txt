The Color Monster

The Color Monster woke up feeling very confused today. His emotions were all mixed up!
"What's the matter?" asked his friend.
"I feel all jumbled up inside. My emotions are in a tangle!"

"Let me help you sort them out," she said.
"When you feel HAPPY, you shine bright like the sun. Everything feels light and bubbly inside.
Your color is YELLOW, like the sunshine that makes you smile.

When you feel SAD, you want to hide away and be alone.
Everything feels heavy and blue. Tears might fall like rain.
Your color is BLUE, like a rainy day that makes you feel down.

When you feel ANGRY, you burn hot like fire inside!
You want to stomp and shout and let it all out.
Your color is RED, like a flame that needs to burn bright.

When you feel AFRAID, you get small and want to run away.
Your heart beats fast and you feel like monsters might be near.
Your color is BLACK, like the shadows that make you scared.

When you feel CALM, you breathe slow and deep.
Everything feels peaceful and right with the world.
Your color is GREEN, like leaves swaying gently in the breeze.

When you feel LOVED, your heart feels full and warm.
You want to hug everyone and share that warmth.
Your color is PINK, like a big heartfelt hug."

The Color Monster put each feeling in its own jar.
Now he understood them all!
"How do you feel today?" his friend asked.
"Today I feel... HAPPY!" said the Color Monster with a big yellow smile.
