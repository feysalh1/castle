Once upon a time, there was a clever little fox with a bright orange coat. He lived in a cozy den at the edge of the forest. Every day, the little fox would explore the woods, making friends with rabbits, squirrels, and birds. One day, the little fox found a lost baby bird who had fallen from its nest. The kind fox carefully picked up the bird and helped it find its way home. The mother bird was so thankful that she sang the most beautiful song just for the little fox. From that day on, whenever the fox felt lonely, he would visit his bird friends who would sing cheerful songs to brighten his day.
