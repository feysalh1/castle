Who's hiding behind the tall oak tree?
Peek-a-boo! I see a brown bear looking at me!

Who's hiding behind the leafy bush?
Peek-a-boo! It's a little fox, so soft and plush!

Who's hiding behind the hollow log?
Peek-a-boo! It's a spotted frog ready to hop!

Who's hiding behind the berry patch?
Peek-a-boo! It's a bunny rabbit with a twitchy nose to match!

Who's hiding behind the pine tree tall?
Peek-a-boo! It's a hooting owl, watching over all!

Who's hiding behind the flower bed?
Peek-a-boo! It's a buzzing bee with a yellow head!

Who's hiding behind the mushroom red?
Peek-a-boo! It's a tiny mouse getting ready for bed!

All the forest friends come out to play,
Waving goodbye as we end our day.
Peek-a-boo! Peek-a-boo!
The forest friends say goodbye to you!
